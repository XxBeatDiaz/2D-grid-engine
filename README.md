# 2D Grid Engine

A lightweight, display-agnostic engine for managing 2D grid-based systems. Perfect for roguelikes, strategy games, or complex grid visualizations in React, Canvas, or the Console.

## Key Principles
* **Layer-Based**: Separate terrain, entities, and effects into independent layers.
* **ECS Driven**: Manage data through an Entity-Component System for maximum flexibility.
* **Agnostic**: Use any rendering method (React, DOM, Canvas, or Terminal).
* **Generic**: Store any data types, from simple characters to complex objects.

## Installation
```bash
npm install @beatdiaz/2d-grid-engine
