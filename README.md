🚀 2D Grid Engine
A lightweight, render-agnostic engine for 2D grid state. Use it for roguelikes, tactics, simulations, or any grid UI. It works seamlessly with React, Canvas, DOM, or the Terminal.

🤔 Why it’s useful
This library does not render. It owns the data model; you choose how to draw it.

Logic Isolation: Keep all your grid logic in one organized place.

Layered Design: Separate terrain, entities, and effects using distinct layers.

Data-Driven: Model your state with ECS-style components.

Renderer Freedom: Swap your frontend (from Canvas to React) without rewriting your game rules.

🎮 Typical Use Cases
Roguelikes: Manage maps with walls, fog-of-war, and items.

Tactical Games: Track units, zones, and pathing data.

Grid Dashboards: Create data visualizations and spreadsheets.

Puzzle Games: Implement stacked rules and complex cell interactions.

📦 What you get
Included
Grid: A bounded 2D coordinate system { row, col }.

Layers: Multiple named layers, each with its own default cell value.

Registries: Centralized storage for Tiles and Entity blueprints.

Instances: Unique entity instances with dynamic component data.

Not included
Rendering: No sprites, animations, or UI widgets.

Physics: No collision resolution beyond what you model in logic.

Pathfinding: You can easily build A\* or Dijkstra on top of the layers.

🏁 Get Started

1. Install
   Bash

npm install @beatdiaz/2d-grid-engine 2. Create a World
Follow the runnable walkthrough in Getting Started.

JavaScript

import { createGridEngine } from '@beatdiaz/2d-grid-engine';

// Create engine with a 10x10 grid
const { grid, entities, tiles } = createGridEngine(10, 10);

// Add layers for different concerns
grid.addLayer('terrain', 'GRASS'); // Static tiles
grid.addLayer('entities', null); // Dynamic instances 3. Render it your way
Read the grid state each frame or after actions, and project it to your chosen display (React, Canvas, or Console).

💡 Core Concepts
Grid: Handles size, bounds checks, and layer storage.

Layer: A matrix of values (terrain, entities, effects).

Tile: Static world data (walkability, metadata, etc.).

Entity: A unique instance with components (health, inventory, AI state).

⚖️ Key Principles
Single Source of Truth: Treat the engine as the absolute state of your world.

Focus Your Layers: Keep concerns separate (Terrain vs. Entities vs. Effects).

Pure Projection: Keep rendering as a pure visual reflection of the underlying state.
